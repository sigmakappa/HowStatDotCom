## HowStatDotCom


Hello there!

A little utility here to scarp data from the site [HowStatDotCom](http://www.howstat.com/cricket/home.asp), the cricket statisticians.

As of now, this contains script to download complete pages locally which can be seamlessly parsed to collate data from them. 

The example here shows downloading data for T20 Batting figures [/PlayerProgressBat_T20.asp?PlayerID=XXXX](http://www.howstat.com/cricket/Statistics/Players/PlayerProgressBat_T20.asp?PlayerID=3600).

#####NOTE

Before running and clooecting data, just change the start and till numbers in downladPage.py and you are all set to go.

Compatible with Python 2.7 as well as 3.5.
