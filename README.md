## HowStatDotCom


Hello there!

A little utility here to scrap data from the site [HowStatDotCom](http://www.howstat.com/cricket/home.asp), the cricket statisticians.

As of now, this contains script to download complete pages locally which can be later seamlessly parsed to collate data from them. 

The example here shows downloading data for T20 Batting figures
 [/PlayerProgressBat_T20.asp?PlayerID=XXXX](http://www.howstat.com/cricket/Statistics/Players/PlayerProgressBat_T20.asp?PlayerID=3600).

### NOTE

Before running and collecting data, just change the start and till numbers in downladPage.py and you are all set to go.

Compatible with Python 2.7 as well as 3.5.
